# google-homepage
In this, my first Odin project, I will be attempting to recreate, visually, if not functionally, the Google.com homepage, utilising the skills I have acquired so far throughout The Odin Project.

Hopefully, by the end of the project I will have demonstrated the ability to create a functional webpage which includes css styling, proper colours and sizes to match the page, adding a footer and an input form, creating working hyperlinks, inserting an image, properly pushing my project to Git, and other skills that I probably haven't even considered at this point in time.

Update: So, a couple of days later and a ton of pushes in which you can see just how much my project changed (and how absolutely terrible my code was, even compared to now - and it's winning no beauty prizes in its final form!), and I have to say that I've learned a LOT. At times, it does still feel as though I'm fumbling in the dark, but it's so rewarding when you persevere and make a breakthrough. 

I'd like to thank the Odin community, particularly on discord, for helping me to put the final touches on the project. Much appreciated, people!
