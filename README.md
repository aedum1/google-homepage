# google-homepage
In this, my first Odin project, I will be attempting to recreate, visually, if not functionally, the Google.com homepage, utilising the skills I have acquired so far throughout The Odin Project.

Hopefully, by the end of the project I will have demonstrated the ability to create a functional webpage which includes css styling, proper colours and sizes to match the page, adding a footer and an input form, creating working hyperlinks, inserting an image, properly pushing my project to Git, and other skills that I probably haven't even considered at this point in time.
